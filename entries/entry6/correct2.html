                You act like you need remindin'<br>
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it<br>
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded<br>
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment<br>
And I can't believe the lies that I went for<br>
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though<br>
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window<br>
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no<br>
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us<br>
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya<br>
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?<br>
If I called, would you pick it up?<br>
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?<br>
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up<br>
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)<br>
All them times I played the fool for you<br>
Thinking we could put it back together, thought we had forever<br>
You never see my point of view<br>
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort<br>
And I can't believe the lies that I went for<br>
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though<br>
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window<br>
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no<br>
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us<br>
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya<br>
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?<br>
If I called, would you pick it up?<br>
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?<br>
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up<br>
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)<br>
You gon' get my hopes high, girl<br>
You gon' get my hopes high, girl<br>
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl<br>
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl<br>
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted<br>
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams<br>
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, hit my line<br>
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini<br>
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid<br>
I see all the signs, I see all the clues<br>
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm binging<br>
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but<br>
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us<br>
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missing ya)<br>
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love? (Love)<br>
If I called, would you pick it up?<br>
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?<br>
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up (Switch it up)<br>
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)<br>
You gon' get my hopes high, girl<br>
You gon' get my hopes high, girl<br>
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl<br>
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl"<br> </div>
