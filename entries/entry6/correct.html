                "Watching the video that you sent me<br>
                The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping<br>
                You know that I'm obsessed with your body<br>
                But it's the way you smile that does it for me<br>
                It's so sweet, knowing that you love me<br>
                Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet<br>
                Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair<br>
                It's so sweet<br>
                Watching the video where you're lying<br>
                In your red lingerie ten times nightly<br>
                You know I think your skin's the perfect color<br>
                But it's always your eyes that pull me under<br>
                It's so sweet, knowing that you love me<br>
                Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet<br>
                Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair<br>
                It's so sweet<br>
                And I will gladly break it<br>
                I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
                And I will gladly break it<br>
                I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
                And I will gladly break it<br>
                I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
                And I will gladly break it<br>
                I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
                It's so sweet, knowing that you love me<br>
                Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet<br>
                Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair<br>
                It's so sweet"<br> </div>
