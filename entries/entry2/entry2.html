<h4>What is this Henry Danger meme?</h4>
<p>The current trending "Henry Danger" meme, particularly on TikTok,
    revolves around clips of the show's main character giving a suspicious or 
    skeptical side-eye. This trend often pairs Henry's reactions with humorous 
    captions, mostly about relationships, cheating, or sneaky behavior, like 
    "When you got a new crush but forget about the one you were with last week"
    or "When someone says ‘I’ll slap everybody here’".</p>

  <h4>Why cant the internet get enough?</h4>
  <p>The internet can't get enough of the Henry Danger meme for several key reasons. 
    First, nostalgia plays a significant role, as many users of TikTok and other 
    platforms grew up watching Henry Danger. The meme taps into the fondness and 
    emotional connection these users have with the show, making it immediately 
    relatable and enjoyable to a broad audience. Second, the meme capitalizes on 
    universally relatable expressions, such as the side-eye or skeptical glance, 
    which can be humorously applied to a variety of real-life situations. Whether 
    it's about relationships, awkward moments, or social faux pas, the meme allows 
    users to express their frustrations or observations in a lighthearted and easily 
    digestible format​</p> <br>

<h4> So why can't *I* get enough and to what extent has this sucked me in as a visual consumer?</h4>
<p> Though I love my boyfriend and cannot personally participate in the visible 
    enjoyment of this newfound trend on TikTok, I have become subtly obsessed and 
    hyper-fixated on these series that I see almost daily. I am so far from hating 
    my boyfriend, yet I find that some of these videos itch a nerve in my body that 
    I was unaware I had. More often than not, many of my hyper fixations will be what 
    I look forward to doing/seeing/watching at the end of the day, and this week these 
    videos have fulfilled that missing role in my life. Additionally, growing up my 
    friends had curated a nickname for me which has stuck not only with me physically, 
    but also literally in the digital form all across my social media platforms. 
    This very nickname is, “Jace Norman”, which was inspired by the actor who plays 
    Henry Danger, weirdly allowing me to feel even more connected and attached to this 
    era in social media than ever before. As I hate to admit this more as the more trendy 
    it gets, if one were to take my phone and scroll through my previous liked videos or 
    posts on Instagram or TikTok, they may find an unpleasant sight of just Henry Danger 
    memes plastered all over the screen.</p>
