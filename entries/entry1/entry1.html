  Korean and Hawaiian cuisines have begun to blend in exciting ways, particularly in Hawaii, where cultural exchange 
  is prevalent. Korean BBQ has gained popularity, often incorporating local ingredients like pineapple and macadamia 
  nuts into marinades and side dishes, creating unique flavor profiles. Kimchi, a staple in Korean cuisine, is frequently 
  served alongside traditional Hawaiian dishes, complementing the milder tastes of local staples. Many restaurants 
  in Hawaii offer fusion dishes that creatively combine elements from both cuisines, such as Korean-inspired poke 
  bowls or loco moco made with bulgogi instead of traditional hamburger patties. Food festivals celebrating both cultures 
  also provide a platform for culinary exchanges, allowing chefs to showcase their innovative combinations. This 
  blending reflects the multicultural landscape of Hawaii, where the Aloha Spirit encourages collaboration and 
  experimentation in food, resulting in delicious and culturally rich dining experiences.

  Having one side of my family in Hawaii, and another be from Koeran, a blend of these two ethnic foods was something almost routine in my childhood and still ever present in my daily life. Being the first year commuting from home, I found myself eating at home out of convenience and health, meaning that, like clockwork, I would find myself reachinginto the firdge to find the same 6 meals: hamburg steak (loco moco), takoyaki, steamed egg rolls, veggie curry, and a Korean pan frien pancake called "Jeon". Without even noticing myself, I found that I could not go a single day without consuming any of these 6 foods, finding myself hyperfixateed on the idea of which one out of lal of them I would eat the next day as I lied in my bed the night before.</p>
